        <div class="answer"> When adding new information to an article, ensure that it is both accurate and verifiable. The content you add should be backed by reliable sources such as books, articles, or official documents. It’s important to follow the site’s content policies, which typically require neutrality, proper citation of sources, and adherence to specific formatting rules.

You can insert citations by using the site’s editor tools, which typically include options for inline citations. To cite a source, you might need to add a reference tag in the text (e.g., [1], [2]) and list the full citation in a separate reference section or bibliography at the end of the article. Using credible sources and properly formatted citations is essential to maintaining the quality and accuracy of the content.</div>

This will restore the article to its previous version. If you're not able to undo the changes, or if the vandalism is more extensive, you can report the issue to the site administrators or moderators. They will typically investigate the situation and take appropriate action, such as blocking the user responsible for the vandalism and restoring the article to its original state.</div>

        <div class="question"> ⮞ 9. How can I suggest a new topic or article to be added?</div>
        <div class="answer">If you want to suggest a new article or topic, you should first search the site to make sure the subject doesn’t already exist. If a similar topic exists but could be expanded, you can contribute to that article instead. If the topic is entirely new, check if there is a "Create Article" or "Red Link" on the website. A red link indicates that an article doesn’t exist yet, and you can create it by clicking on it. Before creating a new article, it’s important to ensure that the topic is notable and has enough reliable sources to support its content.</div>

        <div class="answer">Most websites like Wikipedia have built-in tools for editing tables and images. To add a table, you can use the site's editor to insert a table template or write the necessary HTML code for a custom table. When adding images, make sure the images are properly licensed for reuse or fall under fair use guidelines. You can upload the images to the platform and insert them into the article by using specific image tags. Be sure to include proper image captions and credit to the original source if applicable.</div>
