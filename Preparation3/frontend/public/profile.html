                    Young 40 years old promising entrepreneur that has over 69 businesses, made 420 billion $ in profits
                    and also likes teaching young kids the beautiful discipline, called "Entrepreneurship". I'm called
                    both the "docent" and "doctor" title which really shows my intellectual capacity. I also like
                    working 80+ hours for the sake of entrepreneurship and to show "the normal 8-5 people" what real
                    work is. I shower twice a year, and go to the gym once every decade.

            I started my journey in entrepreneurship at a very young age. By the time I was 10, I had already started my
            first small business selling lemonade in my neighborhood. This early experience taught me the basics of running
            a business and the importance of customer satisfaction. As I grew older, my ventures became more ambitious. In
            high school, I launched a tech startup that developed educational software for schools. This project not only
            earned me significant profits but also recognition in the local business community.
            After graduating from university with a degree in Business Administration, I decided to take my entrepreneurial
            skills to the next level. I founded several companies in various industries, including technology, finance, and
            healthcare. Each of these ventures presented unique challenges and opportunities, but my unwavering
            determination and innovative approach helped me overcome obstacles and achieve success.
