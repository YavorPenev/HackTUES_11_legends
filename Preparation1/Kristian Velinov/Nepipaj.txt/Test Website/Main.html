    <h1 class="change1">1. Practice Mindfulness and Deep Breathing</h1>
    <p class="change">Mindfulness is the practice of staying present in the moment without judgment. Taking a few minutes each day to focus on your breath and be aware of your surroundings can help calm your mind, reduce stress, and increase emotional regulation. Deep breathing exercises, like the 4-7-8 technique, can activate your body’s relaxation response, helping to ease anxiety and promote a sense of calm.</p>

    <h1 class="change1">2. Set Healthy Boundaries</h1>
    <p class="change">Healthy boundaries are essential for protecting your mental well-being. Learn to say "no" when you need to, and recognize your limits. Setting boundaries with work, relationships, and social commitments ensures that you’re not overextending yourself, which can lead to burnout and emotional exhaustion. It’s okay to prioritize your needs.</p>

    <h1 class="change1">3. Create a Consistent Sleep Routine</h1>
    <p class="change">Sleep is one of the most important aspects of mental health. Poor sleep can negatively impact mood, focus, and overall emotional well-being. Establish a regular sleep schedule by going to bed and waking up at the same time each day, creating a relaxing pre-bedtime routine, and avoiding screens before sleep. Quality rest helps your mind recover and boosts resilience against stress.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1 class="change1">4. Engage in Physical Activity</h1>
    <p class="change">Exercise is a powerful tool for managing stress, anxiety, and depression. Physical activity releases endorphins, which can improve mood and provide a natural sense of calm. Whether it's a daily walk, a workout, or yoga, find a form of movement that you enjoy. Regular exercise boosts energy levels and enhances emotional stability.</p>
    <hr>
    <h1 class="change1">5. Reach Out for Support</h1>
    <p class="change">You don’t have to navigate mental health challenges alone. Talk to someone you trust—a friend, family member, or professional. Sharing how you’re feeling can help alleviate emotional burdens and provide perspective. If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider speaking with a therapist who can offer guidance and coping strategies tailored to your unique situation.</p>
